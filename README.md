## Introduce

Icing on the RL is library that helps to config environmet, train, test, plot results and also learning reinforcement learning  
There are various good RL libraries to study RL methods, but I have a little bit confuse and complex to analyze inside code for studying. So I implement RL methods from scratch for learning and feel pleasure of writing and testing RL methods  

The goal of thest project is easy to train, test, evaluate RL methods and also easy to learning RL methods from inside codes
